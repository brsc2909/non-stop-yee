# non-stop-yee
chrome extension that plays the music from the yee meme constantly and quietly in the background

## install 
open chrome://extensions/ in chrome and then drag the .crx file into the browser window and then click ok when it asks to add extension. you can also right click on the icon in the task bar and select hide. I will be uploading to chrome store soon so you will be able to download from there.
